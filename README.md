**What is Lang Chain**
---

LangChain is an open-source framework that helps developers build applications that use large language models (LLMs). LangChain provides tools and abstractions to help developers: 

*   Access, transform, and share data 
*   Manipulate data structures 
*   Chain models
*   Incorporate external agents  
*   Customize, improve accuracy, and make information more relevant  

LangChain simplifies every stage of building LLM application using its open-source building blocks, components, and third-party integrations.


**Introduction to Lang Graph**
---
LangGraph is an open-source library that helps you define, coordinate, and execute multiple language learning model (LLM) agents in a structured way. LangGraph is a framework for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. It allows you to create cyclical graphs, which are essential for developing agent runtimes. LangGraph provides fine-grained control over the flow and state of your application. It includes built-in persistence, enabling advanced human-in-the-loop and memory features.
